# 🧠 Frontend Learnings

Welcome to my personal front-end learning repository! This is a structured collection of hands-on exercises, case studies, and projects created as I build my skills in front-end web development. From basic HTML and CSS to JavaScript, TypeScript, and frameworks like Lit — this repo documents my journey, learnings, and experiments.
