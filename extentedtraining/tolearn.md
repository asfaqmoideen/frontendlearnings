## Practice

**Week 1: Advanced JavaScript Fundamentals**

**Day 1: Functions**

Task 1: Understanding Scope

- Write a function that demonstrates the difference between global and local scope.
- Create a nested function and explain how scope works within it.

Task 2: Lexical Scope

- Write a function that uses a variable from its parent scope.
- Explain how lexical scope works with an example.

Task 3: Closures and Their Use Cases

- Create a function that returns another function, demonstrating closure.
- Write a practical example where closure is used (e.g., a counter function).

Task 4: Currying

- Implement a curried function that adds three numbers.
- Write a practical application of currying (e.g., a function that formats a string).

Task 5: Function Context

- Write examples using `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()` to change the context of a function.
- Explain the differences between these methods.

Task 6: Arrow Functions

- Write examples comparing arrow functions with regular functions.
- Explain the differences in terms of `this` binding and usage.

**Day 2: Asynchronous JavaScript**

Task 1: Callbacks

- Write a function that takes a callback and executes it after a delay.
- Explain the concept of callback hell and how to avoid it.

Task 2: Promises

- Create a promise that resolves after a delay and chain multiple `.then()` calls.
- Write an example using `Promise.allSettled()` to handle multiple promises.

Task 3: Async/Await

- Rewrite the promise example using `async` and `await`.
- Demonstrate parallel vs sequential execution with `async` functions.

Task 4: Event Loop

- Write a function that uses `setTimeout` and `Promise` to demonstrate the event loop.
- Explain the difference between micro-tasks and macro-tasks.

**Day 3: Maps and Sets**

Task 1: Map

- Create a `Map` with key-value pairs and iterate over it.
- Explain the advantages of using `Map` over plain objects.

Task 2: Set

- Create a `Set` with unique values and perform operations like union, intersection, and difference.
- Write a function that removes duplicate values from an array using `Set`.

Task 3: WeakMap and WeakSet

- Create a `WeakMap` and `WeakSet` and explain their use cases.
- Demonstrate how `WeakMap` and `WeakSet` help with memory management and garbage collection.

**Day 4: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

Task 1: Prototypes

- Create an object using a constructor function and demonstrate prototype inheritance.
- Explain the prototype chain with an example.

Task 2: ES6 Classes

- Write a class with static methods, private fields, and inheritance.
- Create instances of the class and demonstrate inheritance.

Task 3: Mixins

- Write a mixin that adds behavior to a class.
- Demonstrate how mixins can be used to combine behaviors for reusable code.

**Day 5: Error Handling and Debugging**

Task 1: Error Types

- Write examples of built-in errors like `TypeError`, `RangeError`, etc.
- Explain how to handle these errors in your code.

Task 2: Custom Errors

- Create a custom error class by extending the `Error` class.
- Write a function that throws the custom error and handle it appropriately.

Task 3: Debugging Tools

- Use Chrome DevTools to debug a piece of code.
- Demonstrate how to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through code.
